# KPI

KPI means Key Performance Indicator.  In this instance, it refers to the performance of support groups through the data collected from a ticketing system.

The structure of this data is very specific, and as thus this program is written in a very specific way:

<ul>
<li>Cases with owners</li>
<li>Tasks with owners tied to Cases</li>
<li>Correspondence with owners tied to Cases</li>
</ul>

When complete, I will provide sample input CSVs so that you can see how the output is formed.
